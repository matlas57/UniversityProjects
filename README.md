# Portfolio
This repository contains Game builds and code samples for applications.
Mystere and Light At The End are 2 projects im especially proud of. 
Both were done with other game developers but I did all the programming for both games as my partners worked on art, sound, design etc.
The code samples are code I wrote for a variety of my university classes assignments. 
Note: some larger projects from university are contained in their own repos:
